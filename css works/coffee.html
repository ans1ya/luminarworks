        <h3>What is Coffee?</h3>
        <img id="flower" src="./images/coffee/Coffee_flower_cherry_wikicommons.jpeg" alt="">

        <p><span>cof·fee /ˈkôfē,ˈkäfē/  noun  The berries harvested from species of Coffea plants.</span> <br>
            Everyone recognizes a roasted coffee bean, but you might not recognize an actual coffee plant.
            Coffee trees are pruned short to conserve their energy and aid in harvesting, but can grow to more than 30 feet (9 meters) high. Each tree is covered with green, waxy leaves growing opposite each other in pairs. Coffee cherries grow along the branches. Because it grows in a continuous cycle, it’s not unusual to see flowers, green fruit and ripe fruit simultaneously on a single tree.

        <h3>History</h3>
        <img id="his" src="./images/coffee/history.jpeg" alt="">

        <p>Coffee grown worldwide can trace its heritage back centuries to the ancient coffee forests on the Ethiopian plateau. There, legend says the goat herder Kaldi first discovered the potential of these beloved beans. 

            The story goes that that Kaldi discovered coffee after he noticed that after eating the berries from a certain tree, his goats became so energetic that they did not want to sleep at night. 
            
            Kaldi reported his findings to the abbot of the local monastery, who made a drink with the berries and found that it kept him alert through the long hours of evening prayer.
